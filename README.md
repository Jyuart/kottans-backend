## Git and GitHub

It was weird to start learning programming with something that is not programming. But after a several tries it seems easy and useful. I also like so much Learn Git Branching. It was somewhat challenging but not so difficult to actully did it.Great tutorial. And now, when I now what Git is, the most difficult task will be to force myself to use it. And I hope it will also help to finally remember all the commands.

(It really was so thrilling to make a first pull request even though it's just adding a couple of lines of greetings.)

## Unix Shell

I've never worked with command line before, but it wasn't that easy. And still, communicating with the PC on this level feels great. I've managed to deal with all quizes on Linux Survival, but returning to them a month later was a challenge. It's really important to use it every day to get used to all commands.
